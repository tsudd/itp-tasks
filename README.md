# itp-tasks
This is the place for cooperative tasks solving from labs in python

## Contribution
Hi guys! There we can share our solutions with each other, discuss them, finding mistakes and improving. So, please, don't be shy to share your code, fill free to make adjuctions and give tips. Together we will kick this subject!

## Some rules
There are some rules:
- Please, lets keep our code and files clean
- you have another solution - just add it!
- every task has it's own branch, so commit your solitions to the specific branch
- in file: to run your code, please create seperate function (like solve()), which has all needed statements to test it, so anyone can call it and easy run your code
- sign your solutions with commentary like # {name}'s solution
- to name branches use this pattern: "task{num}" please replace {num} with number of the specific task number  

## Some instructions
You may ask, how to push your solutions here, so check steps below:
1. Create new branch locally for a solution;
2. Write some code (don't forget to test it);
3. Make commit
4. Push to a branch of the sepicific task 
  - Like if you want to push your solution of the first task use this command:
    ~~~
    $ git push <remote> <local_branch>:<remote_name>
    ~~~
    For more info watch this [link](https://devconnected.com/how-to-push-git-branch-to-remote/ "Pushing branches")
5. Now your solutions is on the task branch and can be pushed to the main.
