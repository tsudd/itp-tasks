# itp-tasks
This is the place for cooperative tasks solving from labs in python

## Contribution
Hi guys! There we can share our solutions with each other, discuss them, finding mistakes and improving. So, please, don't be shy to share your code, fill free to make adjuctions and give tips. Together we will kick this subject!

## Some rules
There are some rules:
- Please, lets keep our code and files clean
- you have another solution - just add it!
- every task has it's own branch, so commit your solitions to the specific branch
- in file: to run your code, please create seperate function (like solve()), which has all needed statements to test it, so anyone can call it and easy run your code
- sign your solutions with commentary like # {name}'s solution
- to name branches use this pattern: "task{num}" please replace {num} with number of the specific task number
